Sourceforge keeps changing its policies and procedures for site
maintenance.  Here are the notes from putting out version 2.2.

To update the web page do the following steps.

-- make whatever changes you need in docs/newpages, and when you are
   done update svn.

-- log in to shell.sourceforge.net as xsb. This is done as:

ssh -t xsb,xsb@shell.sourceforge.net create

then cd to xsb/htdocs (the full path is /home/groups/x/xs/xsb/htdocs).

Copy into the various directories any of the .html or other files you
need.  Eg.

scp index.html xsb,xsb@web.sourceforge.net:/home/groups/x/xs/xsb/htdocs

-- For full releases, add the release file following the instructions of:

http://apps.sourceforge.net/trac/sitedocs/wiki/Release%20files%20for%20download
%https://sourceforge.net/docs/E01/en/#top

-- There are several other directories that may need to be updated.

api -- has generated documentation for XSB  /* TLS: not maintained in v. 3.2 */
manual1 -- subdirectory for manual vol. 1   /* TLS: not maintained in v. 3.2 */
manual2 -- subdirectory for manual vol. 2   /* TLS: not maintained in v. 3.2 */
packages -- subdirecotry for packages manuals

-- Finally, update the news.  Login to sourceforge, under the admin
menu, click news, then submit.  this will bring you to a form where
you can submit the news story.

For Binaries, you can run 

admin/TarRelease.sh

to make an XSB.tar.gz, then move the tar file somewhere, untar it, cd
to the admin directory, and run configure_release.sh.  This makes
optimized versions of 

sequential, 32-bit, local
sequential, 64-bit, local
mt, 32-bit, local
mt, 64-bit, local
sequential, 32-bit, batched

Next, run TarBin.sh to create tarball, and copy over to sourceforge.

Problems

If the xsb password expires, you can't login to shell.sourceforge.net,
even though you can log into sourceforge through a browser.  If this
happens, simply change the password through the browser and things
should work (make sure to notify the relevant developers).
