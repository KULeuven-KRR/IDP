This directory contains files used when building Windows 2000/XP GUI 
installers for XSB using Inno Setup 5.2 (or a later version):

	http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php

In order to build the installer, perform the following steps:

1. Install (or update if necessary) Inno Setup.

2. Compile XSB, if possible, in 32 bits and 64 bits, single-threaded and
multi-threaded.

2. Copy the "xsb.iss" file into your Desktop folder and open it (using
Inno Setup).

3. The "xsb.iss" file assumes that XSB is compiled and available in the
"C:\XSB" folder. If that's not the case, edit the "xsb.iss" file and
change the definition of the variable "MyBaseDir" (around line 13) to
reflect the directory that you're using.

4. Update the XSB release number in the "xsb.iss".
   Look for the strings "XSBVersion".
   Also check the XSB copyright information for possible updates.

5. In the Inno Setup Compiler application, run the menu command
"Build > Compile".

6. Assuming no build errors the generated installer will be found on
your Desktop inside the "Output" directory (or in Output subdirectory
of where xsb.iss was run.)

7. Then upload it to xsb.sourceforge.net.  Login and go to "files"
tab, and then navigate to the desired directory.  And then button
"add file".

8. Update the downloads page; in XSB/docs/homepage/downloads.html:
Update to have right filename for windows installer.  Then upload it
to sf:

In that directory:
 scp downloads.html dwarren,xsb@web.sourceforge.net:/home/project-web/xsb/htdocs/downloads

Then upload installer: (from C:\Users\warren\Desktop\Output, or admin/windows/Output, if there) 
First change permissions locally, so copy on SF will have right permissions.
 chmod 644 xsb-VERSION.exe
 scp xsb-VERSION.exe dwarren,xsb@web.sourceforge.net:/home/project-web/xsb/htdocs/downloads

If permissions are still wrong on SF, then:
 ssh -2 -t dwarren,xsb@shell.sf.net create
 cd /home/project-web/xsb/htdocs
 chmod 644 xsb-VERSION.exe
