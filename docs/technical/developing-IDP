** This documents describes what you need to do to start developping IDP from a fresh Ubuntu install. **


- Suppose you want the idp source in <sourcedir>/idp and want to build in <builddir>/release and <builddir>/debug (depending on whether you build in release or debug of course)
- You will need some software (install it yourself or ask sysadmin)
	>> sudo apt-get install git cmake ccache cmake-gui bison flex texlive-base texlive-latex-base imagemagick latex2html valgrind libgetopt-argvfile-perl libgetopt-long-descriptive-perl libregexp-common-perl g++ eclipse eclipse-cdt texinfo libc6-dev-i386 g++-multilib
- Register a BitBucket account 
	https://bitbucket.org/
- Upload an ssh key to BitBucket 
	https://bitbucket.org/account/user/<BitBucketUserName>/ssh-keys/
- Ask an administrator to give you access to the IDP, idp-latex and MinisatID repositories on BitBucket.
- Make a new directory where you will install IDP to (typically in your home folder to avoid having to type your password every time you install it)
	>> cd ~
	>> mkdir usr
	>> cd usr
	>> mkdir local
- Add the just created directory and ccache to you PATH (in ~/.bashrc add the following): (NOTE: ccache should be first!)
	PATH=/usr/lib/ccache:~/usr/local:~/usr/local/bin:$PATH
- Get p4merge, to the best of our knowledge, the best merge tool for git
	download from http://www.perforce.com/downloads/Perforce/Customer
	throw everything from the tgz you downloaded in your /usr/local folder (or in any other folder installed in your path)
- Configure your git: add the following to ~/.gitconfig (or create the file if nonexistent)
	[user]
		name = <YOUR NAME>
		email = <YOUR.NAME>@cs.kuleuven.be
	[merge]
		tool = p4merge
	[mergetool]
		keepBackup = false
	[core]
		excludesfile = ~/.gitignore_global
		autocrlf = input
	[push]
		default = current
- Configure your global gitignore (types of files you will never want to commit to git): add the following to ~/.gitignore_global
	*.aux
	*.fdb_latexmk
	*.idx
	*.ilg
	*.ind
	*.log
	*.out
	*.rel
	*.synctex.gz
	*.maf
	*.mtc
	*.mtc0
	*.nav
	*.snm
	*.tex.backup
	*.tex~
	*.toc
	*.bbl
	*.blg
	*.kilepr
	*.bib~
	*.bib.backup
	*.backup
	*~
	.history
	*.kate-swp
- Get gccfilter 
	download from http://www.mixtion.org/gccfilter/gccfilter
	put it somewhere in you path, for example in ~/usr/local/bin
	make it executable
- Add a useful make command to your ~/.bashrc (the following):
	alias m='touch <sourcedir>/idp/CMakeLists.txt; make -j 4; gccfilter -c -a make -j 4 install'
- Restart your terminal
- Get the IDP source:
	>> cd <sourcedir>
	>> git clone git@bitbucket.org:krr/idp.git
	>> cd idp
	>> git submodule init
	>> git submodule update
- Configure your build directories
	>> cd <builddir>
	>> mkdir release
	>> cd release
	>> cmake <sourcedir>/idp/ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/usr/local -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Release" -DTESTINGTHREADS=3
	>> m
	>> make check
	>> cd ..
	>> mkdir debug
	>> cd debug
	>> cmake <sourcedir>/idp/ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/usr/local -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Debug" -DTESTINGTHREADS=3
	>> m
	>> make check
- Test if IDP is working correctly
	>> idp -i
	>> print(stdoptions) 
- If this all worked, you can compile IDP
- Next, download an eclipse version, at least Kepler with ++ editing tools
- Install the IDP-IDE as described on http://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/krr/software/idp-ide
- Restart eclipse
- Create a c++ project with as location <sourcedir>/idp
- In eclipse, make sure he accepts C++11:
-> Best solution is on: http://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/mv/msg/373462/909018/#msg_909018
-> Easier solution, but not always working: got to the properties of your c++ project -> "paths and symbols" -> symbols -> set __GXX_EXPERIMENTAL_CXX0X__ to 1 (all configurations all languages to be safe)
- In eclipse, import our code style (can be found in docs/code) such that autoformatting does not ruin our code ;-)
- Go in eclipse to Window->Preferences C++ - editor - content assist - advanced
- Deselect everything you see except for "Parsing-based Proposals" (twice) and "Template Proposals" (twice)
