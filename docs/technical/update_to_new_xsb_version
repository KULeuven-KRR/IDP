There is a complete copy of XSB's source inside IDP's source code in the directory idp/lib/XSB

If you want to update your XSB version, you have to do the following:
- Remove the old XSB source folder in idp/lib/XSB and place the new code there
- Update the version number (if necessary) in XSB_VERSION in idp/CMakeLists.txt
- In your build directory, run "make clean"
- In your build directory, run cmake again (with the same parameters)
