** For Linux **

* Install everything that is mentioned in the developing-IDP file.
* Create new build directory
* Configure it to statically release: (disable XSB, disable SPASS)
 cmake ~/software/idp/ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/cw/dtailocal/bartb/local -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="StaticRelease" -DWITHXSB=OFF -DSPASS=OFF
* make
* make install
* make package
* This last one creates the releasable files
* For compiling in 32bits, make sure you have "g++-multilib" if your architecture is native 64bits


** For Windows **

* You should install some software:
 - Cmake: http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html
 - Gcc: http://sourceforge.net/projects/tdm-gcc/files/TDM-GCC%20Installer/tdm-gcc-webdl.exe/download
 - Bison and flex can be found on https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~bart.bogaerts/bison-flex.zip
* Create new build directory
* Configure it to statically release: (disable XSB, disable SPASS)
 cmake ~/software/idp/ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/cw/dtailocal/bartb/local -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="StaticRelease" -DWITHXSB=OFF -DSPASS=OFF
* Refer in the cmake-gui to the correct bison and flex 
* make
* make install
* make package
* This last one creates the releasable files


** For Mac **

* Similar to linux, except that 
       - macports might be required to get a recent enough compiler, bison and flex.
       - static binaries are not supported on mac, so build a standard "Release"
       - copy the relevant dependencies into the package (libstd, libgcc)
