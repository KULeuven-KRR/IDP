/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lstdc++
* Create new build directory
* Configure it to statically release: (disable XSB, disable SPASS)
 cmake ~/software/idp/ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/cw/dtailocal/bartb/local -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="StaticRelease" -DWITHXSB=OFF -DSPASS=OFF
* TODO: shouldn't we add the -lPIC flag in this case???
* make
* make install
* make package
