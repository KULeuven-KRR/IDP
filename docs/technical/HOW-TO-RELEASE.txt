** For Linux **

* Install everything that is mentioned in the developing-IDP file.
* Create new build directory
* Configure it to statically release: (disable XSB, disable SPASS)
 cmake ~/software/idp/ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/cw/dtailocal/bartb/local -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="StaticRelease" -DWITHXSB=OFF -DSPASS=OFF
