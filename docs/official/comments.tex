\section{Comments}
Everything between \code{/*} and \code{*/} is a comment, as well as everything between \code{//} and the end of the line.  
If a comment block starts with \code{/**}, but not with \code{/***}, then the comment is added as a description to the first thing after that comment block that can have a description.  
Currently, only procedures can have a description.
