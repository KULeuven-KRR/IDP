\section{Terms}
Besides from appearing in theories, terms can also be defined separately, for example for use in a minimize inference. The syntax for declaring a term \code{MyTerm} over a vocabulary \code{MyVoc} is
\begin{lstlisting}
	term MyStruct: MyVoc {
		//contents of the term
	}
\end{lstlisting}
