\section{Include statements}
Everywhere in an \idp file at location \code{dir}, a statement 
\begin{lstlisting}
include "path/to/file"
\end{lstlisting}
is replaced by the contents of \code{dir/path/to/file} or \code{path/to/file} if the first one does not exists. 
If none exist, an error is thrown.
Every file can only be included once; if it is included more often, it will be ignored the second time.
However, if you include a file multiple times in different ways (by using different symbol links for example), we might not detect that it is the same file, and include it more than once.
We discourage this behavior.


A statement
\begin{lstlisting}
include <filename>
\end{lstlisting}
is replaced by the contents of the standard library file \code{filename}.
Currently the following standard library files are available:
\begin{description}
\item[mx] Contains some useful model expansion procedures.
\item[table\_utils] Contains tools for manipulating tables and converting IDP tables to lua tables.
\end{description}
