This is the readme for the IDP system, version 3.0.1-beta.
IDP is a system for representing knowledge in the logic FO(IDP) and applying reasoning on it.
FO(IDP) is a logic consisting of first-order logic, inductive definitions, aggregates, 
partial functions and arithmetic.
Out of the box, the following inferences are supported:
    - grounding
    - modelexpansion
    - propagation
    - evaluating definitions


*** Installing and running the system
Required software packages:
   - C and C++ compiler, supporting most of the C++11 standard. Examples are GCC 4.4 or higher, clang 3.2 or visual studio 11.
   - Cmake build environment. 
   - Bison and flex packages or yacc and lex packages.
   - Pdflatex and doxygen for building the documentation.
   - (optional) Gecode for constraint programming support.

Assume idp is unpacked in <idpdir>, you want to build in <builddir> (cannot be the same as <idpdir>) and install in <installdir>. 
Building and installing is then achieved by executing the following commands:
	cd <builddir>
	cmake <idpdir> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<installdir> -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Release"
	make -j 4
	make check
	make install

Alternatively, cmake-gui can be used as a graphical way to set cmake options.
